                        I used a variety of technologies to build this site, including HTML for structure and CSS for styling.
                        I also used Git for version control and GitHub Pages for hosting the site. 
                        Visual Studio Code was my code editor of choice.

                    <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
                    <p>
                        While creating this portfolio website, one of the main challenges I faced was dealing with small mistakes,
                        such as missing commas and incorrect syntax. These minor errors often caused my code to break,
                        which was quite frustrating at times. I also struggled with implementing the CSS grid layout,
                        as positioning elements correctly required a deeper understanding of how grid systems work.
                        Additionally, I struggled to manage my time due to working two jobs while being a full-time student.
                        I also faced difficulties creating more branches as they were not functioning as expected.

                    <h3>Things I Enjoyed</h3>
                    <p>
                        However, I enjoyed the research process and finding solutions to problems. 
                        I came across a piece of code online that helped me improve my grid structure, which I referenced appropriately.
                        This allowed me to better understand how to create a more responsive and organised layout.
                        One aspect I particularly enjoyed was working on the card background animation. Adding smooth transitions and glowing effects made my website feel more interactive and visually appealing.
                        This experience not only improved my CSS skills but also allowed me to be more creative with my designs.
                        Overall, this project has been a great learning experience, helping me strengthen my attention to detail and problem-solving skills.
                        I aim to use more branches in the future since my branches did not function as they should have.
