                        One of the projects I completed was a Python project, which helped me apply my programming knowledge in a real-world scenario. 
                        I developed my skills in writing efficient code, debugging errors, and solving logical problems. This experience boosted my confidence in working independently.

                        As part of my coursework, I worked on a team project for Software Fundamentals. 
                        This experience taught me teamwork, version control with Git, and effective documentation.

                    I studied Computer Systems, which gave me an understanding of
                     hardware-software interaction, 
                    including memory management, networking, and cybersecurity.
